# Portfolio – Imane Moumoun

This portfolio showcases a selection of my academic projects completed during my engineering studies at **Mines Saint-Étienne (ISMIN)**.  
They highlight my skills in embedded systems, signal processing, prototyping and machine learning, combining both theoretical knowledge and hands-on implementation.

## Programming a line-following robot with STM32 microcontroller

- **Completed:** April–June 2025, *Robot Project Course* at Mines Saint-Étienne  
- **Description:** Developed a line-following algorithm with real-time decision-making using IR sensors, implemented PID control of motors for stable trajectory, and configured UART/Bluetooth interfaces for travel time reception.  
- **Technical Aspects:** STM32 microcontroller (C language), PWM motor control, and UART/Bluetooth communication for remote monitoring.
  
## Designed a liquid level measurement system using a capacitive sensor

- **Completed:** April–June 2025, *Prototyping Project Course*  
- **Description:** Designed a signal conditioning circuit converting capacitance into a frequency readable by an STM32, with integrated Bluetooth interface for calibration, liquid level monitoring, and critical level alerts.
- **Technical Aspects:** Capacitive sensing, analog signal conditioning, PCB prototyping with KiCad and Bluetooth communication.  

## SystemVerilog Modeling of the ASCON Encryption Algorithm

- **Completed:** April–May 2025, *Digital System Design Course* 
- **Description:** Implemented the ASCON-128 encryption algorithm in SystemVerilog to secure user communications by encrypting messages. 
- **Technical Aspects:** RTL module design, testbench verification, and simulation using ModelSim.  

## Developed a client-server application tailored for social networking functionality

- **Period:** April–May 2025, *system programming Course* 
- **Description:** Developed a multithreaded client-server application in C with simultaneous connection handling via sockets, real-time messaging (private and public), and an interactive voting system.
- **Technical Aspects:** C programming, TCP sockets, multithreading with POSIX threads, and network synchronization on Linux. 

## Development of an AI Model 

- **Period:** 2022–2024, *Preparatory Classes (MPSI–MP)*  
- **Description:** Developed an AI model to detect and track a tennis ball using YOLOv5 and TrackNet models.  
- **Technical Aspects:** Dataset annotation with Roboflow, model fine-tuning, and trajectory tracking for “in/out” decision validation.  

## Internship – PELLENC (Pertuis, France)

- **Duration:** January–February 2025  
- **Role:** AI Intern  
- **Description:** Collected and annotated a specialized dataset for olive tree trunk detection, fine-tuned the YOLOv8 model, and optimized hyperparameters to enhance model performance. 
- **Technical Aspects:** Model fine-tuning , hyperparameter optimization and model evaluation.
